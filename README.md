# Checkout

The `checkout(items, prices)` function and the `Checkout` class are both contained within the source file `checkout.py`.

The test files `testCheckoutFunction.py` and `testCheckoutClass.py` import this file and test the function version and class version respectively. They can be run directly from the command line e.g.
```
python3 testCheckoutClass.py
```
There will be an output from each test as to whether it passes or fails, along with summary at the end of the total number of tests passed out of the total undertaken. 

The code should be compatible with Python2 and Python3, although the formatting for the output is geared towards Python3 and will look a bit off using Python2.
